MIPS-Assembly-Language-Projects
===============================

This repository contains MIPS Assembly Language class projects given in our Intermediate CS 240 
Computer Organization class. The projects in this repository contains implementation of for loop, 
if else etc. in MIPS Assembly Language.

About MIPS:
===========
   MIPS (originally an acronym for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) is a reduced 
   instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by MIPS Technologies 
   (formerly MIPS Computer Systems, Inc.). The early MIPS architectures were 32-bit, with 64-bit versions 
   added later. Multiple revisions of the MIPS instruction set exist, including MIPS I, MIPS II, MIPS III,
   MIPS IV, MIPS V, MIPS32, and MIPS64. The current revisions are MIPS32 (for 32-bit implementations) and 
   MIPS64 (for 64-bit implementations).[1][2] MIPS32 and MIPS64 define a control register set as well as 
   the instruction set.
